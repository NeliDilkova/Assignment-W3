## My intreactive plot using plotly
Here, I generate two random normal distributions and overlay them in the plot.
Hover over the plot to see the respective values.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Overlaid histogram of 2 vectors:
graph=plot_ly(x = rnorm(800), opacity = 0.7, type = "histogram", name = "vector X") %>%
    add_trace(x = rnorm(800)+1, name = "Vector Y") %>%
    layout(barmode="overlay")%>%
    layout(title = "Overlaid histogram example",
         xaxis = list(title = "value brackets"),
         yaxis = list(title = "frequency"))
   
graph

```
